# DATA SCIENCE STUDY REPO

## Alura Data Science

Alura is a brazilian company that offers several classes on various tech related areas.
The following Repo was created to host some of its Data Science classes that i'm attending.

## Linear Regression

This project aimed at teaching the basis of linear regression with Python, using this concept to train a model to predict results based on the data analyzed.
On this project you will find two Notebooks that analyzed the effect of the weather on the consumption of beer in a determined area within the year of 2015, and a model that analyzed the correlation between prices and other features some residences presented.
The original data was over 500.000 examples, it was cut short to 1000 for study purposes.

The link to the original data is on the notebook itself.

Using Pickle the model was saved in a binary document that can be used afterwards in another situation until the model is updated.

Studies to go further on machine learning and data science will be taken and this repo will be updated accordingly

## Uptade on 09/21/23

As of this moment, the first 8 courses on using Python for Data Science were finished and I'm going to further my knowledges on statistics using Python, then, the goal is to understand and apply Machine Learning

Courses went from a Statistics basics to Data Visualization and even Analysis of Health Data gathered from Johns Hopkins on the COVID-19 pandemic, every single notebook is on this Repo along with their data.

Since the creation of this Repo I've become a Student on a University in Brazil in the area of Information Systems (IT in General) with a Data Science Specialization at the end of the course. That's the main issue i'm having with updating this Repo more frequently.
